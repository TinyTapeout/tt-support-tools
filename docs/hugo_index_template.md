# Testimonials

Tiny Tapeout is a game changer for undergrad students. It provided my classmate and I with the unique opportunity to create and implement our very own design on an ASIC, something that is often out of reach for undergraduates. I can't stress enough how much I learned throughout the entire process, and that knowledge is truly priceless to me. I couldn't be more grateful for the experience!

Thanks to the hard work of the Tiny Tapeout team, making your own ASIC has gone from an impossible dream to a weekend project!

----

Tiny Tapeout is an amazing project where engineers can get hands on experience designing a digital chip. I have often dreamed about creating a chip design, but thought it as infeasible to do as a hobby project. When I came across Tiny Tapeout on Youtube I was hooked. I immediately created a design and submitted it. The process was relatively simple, but when I did have some questions the community was willing to help!

TinyTapeout is a fantastic way to take your digital design skills to the next level. With great tools and a friendly community, every day working on it was interesting and fun. I'm looking forward to the next TinyTapeout!

Participating in Tiny Tapeout has been a wonderful learning experience and has represented the fulfillment of a dream which I’ve held since I was in high school. The existence of a cheap effective way to get interesting and experimental chips manufactured outside of the university framework represents in my opinion the biggest boon the VLSI industry since its inception. I read a VLSI paper from 1991 “Magic as a PC Layout Tool for Small Budget VLSI Circuit Design,” by O.G. Berkes and R. W. Williams where they dreamed of chip design being in reach of high school students. Finally with the advent of Tiny Tapeout this dream may end up moving closer to reality.

Just yesterday, I was dreaming of a tapeout cooperative, and it turns out to exist. Thanks to you all!! Looking forward to TT05!

Bloop. Just submitted my first chip design to #TinyTapeout  using #Rust  HDL! Amazing how accessible this stuff is thanks to the TT crew's fantastic design tools and documentation.

GCC and Python opened up computing to students and enthusiasts; Tiny Tapeout blew the gates open on the semiconductor digital design process! I’m immensely thankful for the TT team’s efforts towards infrastructure and accessibility; without the tooling's short iteration time & pointed feedback, I couldn’t have imagined a project and figured out how to make it work in the same weekend.
