# Testimonials / Endorsements

Awesome! Sent my design to #TinyTapeout ! Emotion! Thanks 
@matthewvenn , @marunmagesh and crew, for making it possible!

#tinytapeout 3 submission is in! I'm very thankful to be a part of such an amazing project, even if my project is small.

Just to take moment, thank you! I didn't think I would ever get to do something like this, especially with so little cost or pressure.
For context, at work, I was testing an ASIC a supplier designed for us, and that was quite the opposite of both of these.

Hurray, also made a last minute submission, haven't felt that rush since my last university homework submission deadline... Great that a chip design can be done on a weekend, looking forward to getting all the other designs, and thanks everybody who contributed to the platform, it is really easy to use!

I just submitted a last minute project to tt03, wanted to drop by and say kudos for all the resources and the project in general!

I've never done any hardware before (just software), but after reading the updated Code by Petzold earlier in the year and listening to an interview with Jim Keller I had my interest peeked to look at whats going on in the layers I usually take for granted. Really cool to find something like tiny tapeout, nice motivating to actually install some of the tools and give it a try.
